# Nextcloud Breeze Dark Theme
This is a Breeze Dark Theme for [Nextcloud](https://nextcloud.com) based on the Breeze Dark theme made by the KDE Project.

The icons are from the default Nextcloud theme, with the colors changed to better fit a dark theme.

## Progress
Theming for Core Nextcloud functionality is done. You can check on the progress of App styling and request styling for specific apps [here](https://github.com/mwalbeck/nextcloud-breeze-dark/issues/2)

## Installation
The master branch will always be the current stable release so you can clone that for easy installation and updates.

You can also download it as a zip file and extract it to your themes folder.

To enable the theme, add or change the theme option in your config.php to:

    'theme' => 'nextcloud-breeze-dark',

## Contributions

The theme is written with [Sass](http://sass-lang.com/).
