You can find the colours used for the theme and their variable names in **_colours.scss**. Changes to icons should go in the **_icons.scss**. Changes to Nextcloud core should go in **_core.scss**. Styling for apps can be found in the **apps** folder with a specific file for each app. For new apps please place the styling in a new file called **_APPNAME.scss** in the **apps** directory and import it at the bottom of **style.scss**.

Please make your pull requests to the **develop** branch.
